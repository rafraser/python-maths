# Typecheat

I'm usually a pretty fast typer without cheating; but sometimes I just want to use my programming skills for evil.
This script was originally created to cheat at [Tower Unite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394690/Tower_Unite/) Typeracer & was later revised for more general purposes.

Unfortunately, this cheat is *too* fast for Tower Unite. Since Tower Unite creates a particle effect when typing, this will break things if the cheat runs too quickly. Oops.
